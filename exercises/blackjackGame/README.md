Question #7 from LearnCPP Chapter 11.x

a) Alright, challenge time! Let’s write a simplified version of Blackjack. If you’re not already familiar with Blackjack, the Wikipedia article for Blackjack has a summary.

Here are the rules for our version of Blackjack:

- The dealer gets one card to start (in real life, the dealer gets two, but one is face down so it doesn’t matter at this point).
- The player gets two cards to start.
- The player goes first.
- A player can repeatedly “hit” or “stand”.
- If the player “stands”, their turn is over, and their score is calculated based on the cards they have been dealt.
- If the player “hits”, they get another card and the value of that card is added to their total score.
- An ace normally counts as a 1 or an 11 (whichever is better for the total score). For simplicity, we’ll count it as an 11 here.
- If the player goes over a score of 21, they bust and lose immediately.
- The dealer goes after the player.
- The dealer repeatedly draws until they reach a score of 17 or more, at which point they stand.
- If the dealer goes over a score of 21, they bust and the player wins immediately.
- Otherwise, if the player has a higher score than the dealer, the player wins. Otherwise, the player loses (we’ll consider ties as dealer wins for simplicity).
- In our simplified version of Blackjack, we’re not going to keep track of which specific cards the player and the dealer have been dealt. We’ll only track the sum of the values of the cards they have been dealt for the player and dealer. This keeps things simpler.

Start with the code you wrote in quiz #6. Create a function named playBlackjack(). This function should:

- Accept a shuffled deck of cards as a parameter.
- Implement Blackjack as defined above (note: you can define other functions to help with this).
- Returns true if the player won, and false if they lost.
Also write a main() function to play a single game of Blackjack.

b) Extra credit: Critical thinking time: Describe how you could modify the above program to handle the case where aces can be equal to 1 or 11.
    It’s important to note that we’re only keeping track of the sum of the cards, not which specific cards the user has.

c) In actual blackjack, if the player and dealer have the same score (and the player has not gone bust), the result is a tie and neither wins. Describe how you’d modify the above program to account for this.
