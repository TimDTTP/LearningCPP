# Problem
Given...
    - int, n
    - int, delay
    - int, forget

Return...
    - int

Where...
starting with one person with the secret, they can start sharing the secret 
to one more person each day after \{delay} days of discovering the secret. 
However, each person will forget the secret after \{forget} days after 
discovering it. Given \{n} days, return the number of people aware of the 
secret at the end of \{n} days. A person cannot share the secret on the same 
day of forgetting.
Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7
