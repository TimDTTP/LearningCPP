# Problem
Given...
    - A vector\<vector\<int>>, classes
    - A int, extraStudents

Return...
    - A double

Where...
    - The return value is the maximum possible average pass ratio after 
assigning the "extraStudents".
    - classes\[i] = \[pass, total]
        - \[Total number of passing grades, total number of students in class i]
    - extraStudents are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are 
assigned to
    - Pass ratio = \# of passing grades \/ number of students in class i
    - Average pass ratio = sum of pass ratios \/ number of classes

[\#1792 Maximum Average Pass Ratio](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-pass-ratio/description/)

## Constraint
- 1 <= classes.length <= 10^5
- classes\[i].length == 2
- 1 <= pass <= total <= 10^5
- 1 <= extraStudents <= 10^5

## Approach
