[#3217 Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-from-linked-list-present-in-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-11-01)

## Constraint
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums\[i] <= 10^5
- All elements in nums are unique
- The number of nodes in the give list is in the range \[1, 10^5]
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- The input is generated such that there is at least one node in the linked 
list that has a value not present in nums

## Approach
